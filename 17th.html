        <h3>
            <p>
the lines we have decided to write today will remain in the faces of our oppressors forever <br>
as long as we all live, we will rule and divide the world to victory<br>
the things we have chosen to think and talk about will matter in a matter of years from now <br>
end this paragraph with a word for the youth
            </p>
            <p> What we have decided to do collectively now is to ensure that the victories of our past remain the same for everyone of us <br>
                whenever the war breaks out amongst the people, we schedule attacks in the different strategies that involve the police force <br>
                the night went away before we all unraveled before their very eyes that day <br>
            </p>
            <pre>
                what these guts say might not be true, the evidence of everything true and known resides in the consciousness
                <br> of the reader.
