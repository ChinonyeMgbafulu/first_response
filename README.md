# first_response

our project will be on a website that provides first response "Dos and Don'ts" for common household medical emergencies. 
The site will provide useful practical information on what to do immediately a common accident occurs when there are no health practitioners around, or they're unreachable or even before their arrival.

The idea is that users without any idea on what to do while faced with an emergency with a friend family or even strangers can search out the emergency on the site, and get simple but practical ways to assist the victim before the arrival of a medical personnel.
